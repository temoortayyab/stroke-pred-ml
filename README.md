#Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of all deaths. Early detection and intervention are crucial, as prompt treatment can significantly improve outcomes and reduce long-term disability. Addressing stroke prevention and improving prediction models can play a vital role in mitigating its impact on health.

#Data Description and Project

This project develops and evaluates a stroke prediction model, and identifies the most influential features for making predictions. The dataset includes information on demographic factors such as gender, age, residence, etc.) and health-related parameters (i.e. hypertension, smoking status, glucose levels, etc.). The project was conducted in R, version 4.3.1. The data can be downloaded [here](kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

The .md file describes the steps taken to develop the model, including information on data exploration and data cleaning, building and testing various ML algorithms, and feature detection.
